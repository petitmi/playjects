The news of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the war I once thought would probably lead to the World War, is gradually overwhelmed by the much more brutal 2023 Israel–Hamas war. The prophecy I made when I was ten occurred to me more frequently that I would experience some severe war, or a coup d'état, or a revolution, or the combination. Is the world situation getting tight? Will I witness a bloody war as severe as World War II (WWII)?

The question is as significant as the cruelty of wars. Jean-Paul Sartre said, ‘When the rich wage war, it’s the poor who die.’ Ordinary people, unable to escape to a private island in their private helicopter, must either starve in half-destroyed places, constantly running, or become soldiers engaged in killing others violently. They also have to grapple with mental issues throughout their lives, even if they survive the war.

After reviewing the list of wars and discovering many I hadn’t known about, I was amazed at how humans could create so many tragic wars and decided to analyze the war situation and calculate the likelihood of a war occurring in my lifetime.

To start the analysis and calculate the possibility, I should answer these two questions first:

What defines a war as ‘bloody’?
Which model is suitable for estimating the probability?
Before delving into the details, let me first share the results:

- The likelihood of humanity experiencing a bloody war, defined as one that results in more than 0.36% of deaths to the global population (288 million deaths based on the current population), by 2050 is estimated to be 99.85%.
The likelihood of witnessing more than 3 conflicts per year is calculated to be 62.74%.
Surprising facts:

- Considering the population at the time, the bloodiest war wasn’t WWII but one of the Chinese civil wars, the Taiping Rebellion.
The longest war, Arab separatism in Khuzestan, has lasted for over 100 years and ended in 2022.
After 1989, there have been no bloody wars, and conflicts have become more frequent, less lethal, and longer.
